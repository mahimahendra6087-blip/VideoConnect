# User Guide: How to Join a Meeting

You currently have the app running! Here is how to test it yourself.

## Step 1: Open the App
1.  Open your browser (search for **Network** in your terminal output to confirm the port, it might be `5173` or `5174`).
2.  Go to: **http://localhost:5173** (or 5174)

## Step 2: Login
1.  You will see the "Annual Conference" / Login page.
2.  Since you are new, click **"Register here"** at the bottom.
3.  Enter a username (e.g., `User1`) and password.
4.  Click **Register**.

## Step 3: Create a Meeting
1.  After logging in, you will see a page with "New meeting".
2.  Click the blue **"New meeting"** button.
3.  This will create a room and put you in it.
4.  Look at the URL bar or the bottom left of the screen. You will see a long ID (like `a1b2-c3d4...`). **Copy this ID**.

## Step 4: Join as a Second Person
To test video, you need a second person. You can be that person!

1.  Open a **New Incognito Window** (Right-click Chrome icon -> New Incognito Window).
2.  Go to **http://localhost:5173** again.
3.  **Register** as a different user (e.g., `User2`).
4.  On the "New meeting" page, paste the **ID** you copied earlier into the text box ("Enter a code or link").
5.  Click **"Join"**.

🎉 **Success!** You should now see two video windows (both showing you).
